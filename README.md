# The Intension
If a large amount of water, lava, tar or any other liquid is needed, you are standing in front of the source and hold down the left mouse button like forever. Since this is rather boring we have written the __SCRIPT__, which takes over the mouse click for you.

# Requirements
- Python3
- The module __Keyboard__<br>
  <code>pip install keyboard</code>

- The module __pyautogui__<br>
  <code>pip install pyautogui


# How to Use

- Start skript
- Press <code>shift+p</code> to start mouse click
- Press <code>shift+p</code> stop mouse click
- Press <code>shift+esc</code> to  abort
